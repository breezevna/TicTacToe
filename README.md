# Tic-Tac-Toe in WPF

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe using the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) framework in C#. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in several important areas of software development:  

**1. User Interface (UI) Design**
By creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game in WPF, I've showcased my ability to design and build a visually appealing and interactive user interface. The game board, player input, and game status display all reflect my skills in creating intuitive and engaging UI components.  
**2. Event Handling**   
Tic-Tac-Toe involves user interactions with the game board, including mouse clicks to make moves. I've implemented event handlers to respond to these user actions, demonstrating my understanding of event-driven programming.  
**3. Game logic**  
This project includes the underlying game logic for Tic-Tac-Toe. It showcases my ability to design and implement game rules, check for win conditions, and handle game state transitions.
**4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
The codebase is structured using object-oriented principles, with classes for the game board, players, and game state. This demonstrates my knowledge of OOP concepts and design patterns.
